# What Does the Agent Do?

## The program we're building is a CLI tool that:

- Accepts a coding task (e.g., "strings aren't splitting in my app, pweeze fix 🥺👉🏽👈🏽")
- Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task, for example:
- Scan the files in a directory
- Read a file's contents
- Overwrite a file's contents
- Execute the Python interpreter on a file
- Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails miserably, which is possible)
- For example, I have a buggy calculator app, so I used my agent to fix the code:


## > uv run main.py "fix my calculator app, it's not starting correctly"

 Calling function: get_files_info
 Calling function: get_file_content
 Calling function: write_file
 Calling function: run_python_file
 Calling function: write_file
 Calling function: run_python_file
 
## Final response:

 Great! The calculator app now seems to be working correctly. The output shows the expression and the result in a formatted way.
